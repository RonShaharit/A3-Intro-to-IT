                <h3>Anin</h3>

                <p>I believe that once again our group worked quite well together. We initially started off very strong, not wasting any time by immediately assigning ‘homework’ to complete one part of the report whilst we were still refining our main overall project idea. Initial meetings were very productive in which ideas were shared and acknowledged by all members consolidating a shared vision of the project outcomes early on.  <br><br>

                Our method of splitting the group of 6 into two teams, being that of the ‘Game Development Team’ and the ‘Report Writing Team’, was a new approach amongst the group. This dynamic I felt made the report a lot easier to handle given discussions could take place within a smaller team where tasks and discussion were a lot more manageable, and objectives were very clear. At times however given this separation it was easy to lose track of the opposing teams progress/outcomes and as a result consistent communication debriefs between the teams were necessary to make sure work remained consistent. <br><br>

                Deadlines were again one of our drawbacks as people were not able to complete work on time, pulling the reports completion closer to the deadline. This was also made more difficult given the poor communication of members online (e.g. meeting unattendance / little use of MS Teams chat). <br><br>

                Overall we worked well together, learning many lessons from our previous assignment to produce a detailed report, alongside a really unique/creative project which surpassed my initial expectations. </p>

                <h3>Ron</h3>
                <p> For assignment three, the group was divided into two different teams. The first being the game development team consisting of myself, Ivan, and Kelvin. 
                    The second being the report writing team having Anin, Albert and Altaf. 
                    As the leader of the game developers, I was overall happy with the early weekly progress me and Ivan made each week, as the soft deadlines of asset creations and the overall script was well executed.  
                    The early communication in my team was also good, with constant use of teams, I found that the daily interactions helped to keep development on schedule. Based on assignment two, the team had previous experience in using teams, setting up meetings and noting down the important work to be met by the following week. 
                    Furthermore, as both the report writers and developers use the same message board, every update was well noted for a good overall final report. However, I do have to mention that towards the end of the assignment some things could be improved on. Communication at times was a bit lacking, which could be due to each member having additional end of semester obligations. Thus, some of the soft deadlines met were not accomplished, pushing some tasks to the last week.
                </p>

                <h3>Albert</h3>
                <p>In my opinion we worked effectively together as a group since everyone was highly organized and each portion was divided evenly to lessen the workload. The weekly meetings were an excellent method to keep track of everyone's work and to address any questions or concerns we had regarding the project.  <br><br>

                Although the number of meetings that were conducted suffered at times due to miscommunication, it still proved to be an effective way to collaborate. The group was split into two, one focusing on the creation of the game whilst the other concentrated on which helped us to be more productive and produce higher quality work. As a part of the report writing team, it made it easier to keep track of and communicate to the team; all the work that was meant to be completed. <br><br>

                Things that could have been improved; having more frequent meetings to help us keep on track and allow group members to gauge where everyone is at that stage and make the necessary changes to the timeline. As well as people not hitting soft deadlines that were set which posed issue especially during the final stretch where everything needed to come together. As such some team members did not upload their section making the final report as well as artefacts delayed. </p>

                <h3>Ivan</h3>
                <p>Overall, I think that our group did very well working on assignment 3. Before even starting the assignment we already had a rough idea on the roles of each team member when working on assignment 2. We immediately started researching on how we would go on about creating our game that is to be presented in assignment 3, by looking through videos and tutorials online. <br><br>

                When we had our first meeting, we had quickly assigned workload for each team member which had basically resulted into two separate teams: the main report writers, and the game development team. Doing so made the project go along much smoother as I was a part of the game dev team, it made it much easier only having to focus on a specific role which was creating illustrations and assets for the end game with some occasional writing needed for the report.  <br><br>

                In terms of any drawbacks, I think that everyone did well in terms of reaching deadlines, but some members are not communicating effectively in teams in terms of updating team members on the work finished in the week. As I have noticed some members only show what they have done during meetings. Making it much more difficult for other team members to gauge when specific sections must be completed.</p>
